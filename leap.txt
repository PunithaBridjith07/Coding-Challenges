/* Introduction
A leap year (in the Gregorian calendar) occurs:

In every year that is evenly divisible by 4.
Unless the year is evenly divisible by 100, in which case it's only a leap year if the year is also evenly divisible by 400.
Some examples:

1997 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 4.
1900 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 400.
2000 was a leap year! */


function year(year:number):string{
    let y = "";

    return y;
}

console.log(year(2100));
