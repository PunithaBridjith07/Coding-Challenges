// INTRODUCTION
// In some English accents, when you say "two for" quickly, it sounds like "two fer". Two-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free. So the phrase "two-fer" often implies a two-for-one offer.

// Imagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!"). You take the offer and (very generously) decide to give the extra cookie to someone else in the queue.

// INSTRUCTIONS
// Your task is to determine what you will say as you give away the extra cookie.

// If you know the person's name (e.g. if they're named Do-yun), then you will say:

// One for Do-yun, one for me.
// If you don't know the person's name, you will say you instead.

// One for you, one for me.
let Name:string = "Alice";
export function twoFer(name?:string): string {
    if(name){ 
      return `One of ${name}, one for me.`;
    }else{
      return "One of you, one for me.";
    }
  }
  
console.log(twoFer(Name));
console.log(twoFer());
